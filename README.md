# NotSAFE

NotSAFE is a ML-backed web app that informs the user the percentage of his/her signup password being hacked or chances of potential hack. We have used Deep Learning to generate intellectual passwords from a corpus of hacked passwords available on the internet. It then matches the password at the time of signup whether it has already been generated by our algorithm with a hack probabilty of 100% or give it a probabilty of being hacked as a percentage.   

## Tools & Technology Used

NotSAFE Web App is built using React and with Flask as the API backend and it uses Keras for training our Deep Learning Model.
